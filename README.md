# 💖 Interactive Proposal Web App

A fun, cute, and interactive mini web project that asks a simple question in a playful way — **“Will you go out with me?”**  
The experience is enhanced with animated GIFs and clever button behavior that makes saying “No” nearly impossible 😄.

## 🧩 How It Works

1. The page loads with a question and two buttons: **Yes** and **No**
2. Clicking **Yes**:
   - Changes the question text
   - Switches the GIF
   - Updates the button behavior
3. Clicking **Yes** again:
   - Displays a goodbye message
   - Hides both buttons
4. Hovering over **No**:
   - The button randomly moves across the screen to avoid being clicked

This creates a playful, almost game-like interaction rather than a static page.
